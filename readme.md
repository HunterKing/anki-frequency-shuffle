# Anki Freq Shuffle
For users who use a frequency dictionary to sort their upcoming new cards. If you make your own cards with sentences or with grammar for example, you will not have a value to automatically grab from a dictionary. This plugin will allow you to set a target range, and a card tag to fetch all of the cards and generate random values between the two ranges in an effort to integrate those cards more easily into the existing deck.

## Installation
Copy the `anki-freq-shuffle` folder into your Anki addons directory, then restart Anki. To find your addon folder, go to the addons menu in Anki, and click "View Files".

## Usage
Go to the anki plugin configuration, set your lower and upper bounds, and your target tag. Go to the "Tools" menu and click "Generate Random Frequencies".
